README for mySort - ShellSort

Shellsort is a type of insertion sort that moves items many positions ahead that allow
for exchanging distant items with one another. The main objective of shell sort is reach a gap of 1 
to compare to the adjecent element to have a fully sorted array. 

Given Array: 12, 34, 54, 2, 3

Step 1: start by finding gap, where n is length 

gap = n/2

gap = 5/2 = 2 remainder 1


step 2: compare items with gap size of 2
therefore, temp selects 2 and compares with 34

temp = 2 

Compares 2 in arr[3] and 34 at arr[1]
since 2 is less than 34, these items are placed in a temp
and swapped

output = 12, 2, 54, 34, 3

Step 3: continue using shellsort iteration to swap items 
into desired sorting

Next selection is 

temp = 3

compares 3 at arr[4] amd 54 at arr[2]

with the selected temp, we now compare 3 and 54, since 54 is 
larger than 3, items are swapped

output = 12, 2, 3, 34, 54

This reduces the gap to n/4

Step 4: Now gap is reduced to n/4, n = 1, the array elements
that are lying at the interval of one are sorted, thus the array is 
now completly sorted

output = 2, 3, 12, 34, 54

Complexity analysis = comparisons of O(n^2)
